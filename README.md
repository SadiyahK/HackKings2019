# Animal Shelter Website

This project was developed at a 24-hour hackathon at Vodafone's headquaters.

The aim of this project was to create a website for animal shelters to advertise events and animals up for adoption to their local community.
Users can view animal profiles and be matched to an animal based on their lifestyle.
